                designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. We will be going

                <h3>Spyware</h3>
                <aside>Spyware is 
                    unwanted software that infiltrates your computing device, stealing your internet 
                    usage data and sensitive information.Spyware is classified as a 
                    type of malware — malicious software designed to gain access to or damage your 
                    computer, often without your knowledge. Spyware is classified as;</aside>

                <h3>Trojans</h3>
                <aside>In computing, a Trojan horse (or simply trojan) is any malware which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.</aside>

                <aside>Trojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear not suspicious, (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on some fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. Trojans may allow an attacker to access users' personal information such as banking information, passwords, or personal identity. It can also delete a user's files or infect other devices connected to the network. Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a trojan.</aside>

                <aside>Unlike computer viruses, worms, and rogue security software, trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.</aside>

            <h3>Ransomware</h3>
            <aside>Ransom malware, or Ransomware, is a type of malware that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files and demands ransom payment in order to regain access. The earliest variants of ransomware were developed in the late 1980s, and payment was to be sent via snail mail. Today, ransomware authors order that payment be sent via cryptocurrency or credit card.</aside>
            <aside>There are several different ways that ransomware can infect your computer. One of the most common methods today is through malicious spam, which is unsolicited email that is used to deliver malware. The email might include booby-trapped attachments, such as PDFs or Word documents. It might also contain links to malicious websites.</aside>

            <h3>Keyloggers</h3>
                <aside>Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program. </aside>
                <aside>A keylogger can be either software or hardware. While the programs themselves are legal, with many of them being designed to allow employers to oversee the use of their computers, keyloggers are most often used for stealing passwords and other confidential information.</aside>
