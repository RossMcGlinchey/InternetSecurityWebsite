            <aside>It is very easy to fall into several traps set up by 
                hackers in a bid to gain access to your account. From here they can do several 
                things such as leak important documents to the internet or even lock you out of 
                your computer until you pay a ransom. Below you will find our recommendations to 
                help prevent this stuff as much as possible.</aside>

                <h3>Two Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
                <aside>2FA is an excellent 
                    tool that most log on interfaces offer. Essentially this means that you can have 
                    two forms of protection when attempting to log into your account. You can choose 
                    the forms of authentication that you wish to use. These include but are not 
                    limited to;</aside>

                <h3>Stronger Passwords</h3>
                <aside>While this is probably one of the 
                    most common solutions for internet security, many people do not take it 
                    seriously enough. Hackers have managed to create programs which will allow them 
                    to brute force attack websites with large masses of common passwords at once. 
                    Password crackers are also available to decrypt the letters. It can be easily 
                    avoided by doing the following;</aside>
                <aside>Avoid passwords that are easily 
                    guessed e.g. pet names, favorite sports team etc.</aside>
                <aside>Use special 
	               symbols in regular words, as this will make it extremely hard to crack the 
                    password.</aside>
                <aside>Abbreviate phrases, as this 
                    makes it almost impossible to crack.</aside>
                <aside>Have different passwords for EVERYTHING.</aside>

            <h3>MalwareBytes</h3>
            <aside>Malwarebytes (formerly known as Malwarebytes Anti-malware) is primarily a scanner that scans and removes malicious software, including rogue security software, adware, and spyware. Malwarebytes scans in batch mode, rather than scanning all files opened, reducing interference if another on-demand anti-malware software is also running on the computer.</aside>
            <aside>Malwarebytes is available in both a free and a premium paid version. The free version can be run manually by the user when desired, whereas the paid version can perform scheduled scans, automatically scan files when opened, block IP addresses of malicious web sites, and scan only those services, programs and device drivers that are currently in use.</aside>

            <h3>Avoid Pirating Programs</h3>
                <aside>While many internet providers have 
                    taken steps to prevent their users illegally downloading software, it is still 
                    happening everyday. The large majority of the files tend to be safe, however, 
                    many are also filled with files of malicious intent. While some pirating sites 
                    allow users to view what is in each file before downloading it, they are always 
                    very well hidden. It is especially important that this is not done on a network 
                    with multiple computers/devices connected to each other as this can allow the 
                    virus to spread indefinitely between all the machines, replicating. This is a 
                    massive problem because even if you completely wipe one computer, it is 
                    extremely likely to come back as its embedded on the network.</aside>
